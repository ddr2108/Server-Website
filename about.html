<div id="info">Hey! Welcome to my website. As you probably know (since you are on this website), my name is Siddhartha Datta Roy, but
everyone calls me Deep. I am a second year student at Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>I was born in Tucker, GA on May 8, 1991. I lived in Tucker till the age of 6 when I moved to the neighboring city of Lilburn, GA. There are many things I enjoy
doing in my free time. I know how to play both the piano and the violin. I did Tae Kwon Do for 6 years and became a second degree black belt. In addition, 
I enjoy playing volleyball and ultimate frisbee. I also enjoy watching sports, particularly baseball, basketball, and football. I mostly keep up with the local Atlanta 
professional teams, but now that I am a Yellow Jacket, I spend a lot of time keeping up with Georgia Tech sports.  </p>

<p>I went to high school at Parkview High School in my hometown of Lilburn, GA. There I participated in many clubs and teams. I was a member
of many honor societies. These include Beta Club, National Honor Society, Science National Honor Society, Spanish National Honor Society, and 
Mu Alpha Theta. Through these organizations I did a great deal of volunteer work. In addition, I held leadership positions in many of these same honor
societies. In the National Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta, and Science National Honor Society, I was the treasurer of the club. I also held leadership 
positions in other clubs too, such as Computer Science Club, where I was the Vice President. In addition, I was the member of many academic teams at my school. 
I was a member of the Academic Bowl Team, where I was on the A team. We were quite successful, placing highly in many local and state competitions. I was a member
of the A team in the Economics Challenge Competition, where my team was quite successful. I was also a member of the A team of my school's Science Bowl
team. My team was quite successful, placing 1st in a number of local and state competitions and went on to compete at the national level. However, the academic
team on which I had the greatest success was Math Team. There I placed in over a dozen competitions, including several 1st and 2nd place finishes. 
After 4 years at Parkview, I graduated in the Class of 2009 as the Salutatorian of my class with a 4.0 gpa. I also came out with great results on the SAT and ACT, with a 2360 on the SAT and a perfect 36 on the 
ACT. In addition, I came out with a great number of college credits through my success on the AP exam, having taken 14 AP classes and coming to Georgia Tech with 37 credits. </p>

<p>I am now in college at Georgia Tech, where I am now a second year. I have great goals at Georgia Tech. I want to graduate with a degree in Computer Engineering
and with a minor in Computer Science. I also want to do multiple internships during my time at Georgia Tech. In addition, I want to do a lot of research so
that I am exposed to a great number of fields. I am working on research with Biomedical applications. Specifically I am working to create programs and applications to help diagnose 
and rehbilatate vestibular disorders. In addition, I have worked on research with Computer Science applications, specifically research dealing with bulding and operation a
website. I want to continue doing more research in my remaining years at Georgia Tech to be exposed to more new things so that I can be a more 
well-rounded engineer when I leave Georgia Tech. In addition, I enjoy programming, so I have tried to learn a number of programming languages, such as Visual Basic, 
Matlab, C, and Labview, and JAVA. In addition, I have speant some time learngin to write HTML along with PHP and mySQL. All of these goals lead to a great deal of work. However, when I do have 
free time, I enjoy going to Georgia Tech football and basketball games and playing in intermurals. </p>
